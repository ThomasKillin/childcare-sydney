<br/>
## Summary
<br/>

**This project aims to investigate the cost of Childcare, specifically Long day care,** 
**in the Sydney region, as well as the relationship between childcare fees and family incomes.**
**Publically available data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was used for the analysis.**

<br/>
The raw data is categorised into regional areas of Sydney defined as Statistical Areas 3 (SA3). 
These are defined by the ABS as follows:

> SA3s are designed to provide a regional breakdown of Australia. 
> They generally have a population of between 30,000 and 130,000 people. 
> In regional areas, SA3s represent the area serviced by regional cities that have a population 
> over 20,000 people. In the major cities, SA3s represent the area serviced by a major transport 
> and commercial hub. They often closely align to large urban Local Government Areas 
> (e.g. Gladstone, Geelong). In outer regional and remote areas, SA3s represent areas which are 
> widely recognised as having a distinct identity and similar social and economic characteristics.

This categorisation allows us to look at how childcare prices vary across the different regions 
as well as how the median incomes in each region are related to childcare prices.
<br/>
<br/>
The raw data includes information on different types of childcare, including before school care, 
after school care and long day care. This analysis is focused on long day care, which typically 
provides up to 10 - 12 hours care during business days to allow parents to return to work. The cost
of long day care is therefore an important parameter as it may impact parents decisions on whether 
to return to work or not.


<br/>
The investigation is split into 3 sections:

1. **Childcare fees by regional area of Sydney**
2. **Geographic mapping of childcare prices**
3. **Childcare fees vs family incomes**

<br/>
TO DO:
estimate annual childcare fees based on hourly rates
