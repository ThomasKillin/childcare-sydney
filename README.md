# Childcare in the Sydney region

This project aims to investigate the cost of Childcare, specifically Long day care, in the Sydney region, as well as the relationship between childcare fees and family incomes. Publically available data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was used for the analysis.

The raw data is categorised into regional areas of Sydney defined as Statistical Areas 3 (SA3). These are defined by the ABS as follows:

SA3s are designed to provide a regional breakdown of Australia. They generally have a population of between 30,000 and 130,000 people. In regional areas, SA3s represent the area serviced by regional cities that have a population over 20,000 people. In the major cities, SA3s represent the area serviced by a major transport and commercial hub. They often closely align to large urban Local Government Areas (e.g. Gladstone, Geelong). In outer regional and remote areas, SA3s represent areas which are widely recognised as having a distinct identity and similar social and economic characteristics. https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.001~July%202016~Main%20Features~Statistical%20Area%20Level%203%20(SA3)~10015

This categorisation allows us to look at how childcare prices vary across the different regions as well as how the median incomes in each region are related to childcare prices

The investigation is split into 3 sections:

1. Childcare fees by regional area of Sydney
2. Geographic mapping of childcare prices
3. Childcare fees vs family incomes


TO DO:
estimate annual childcare fees based on hourly rates
